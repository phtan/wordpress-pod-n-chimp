Caveats.
- For a subscriber new to MailChimp is sync-ed to it, The subsciber will receive an email telling him to log in.
- The Interest Groupings that correspond to Pods relationship fields must already have been set up.
- Strict 1-1 matching between Pods and MailChimp for now. ie. Changes to email addresses in Pods will not be sync-ed to MailChimp, nor will changes to other fields once the email address has been changed.
