Caveats.
- Email addresses that are new to MailChimp will receive an opt-in email when they are sync-ed across from Pods.
- The Interest Groupings that correspond to Pods relationship fields must already have been set up in MailChimp.
- Strict 1-1 matching between Pods and MailChimp for now. ie. Changes to email addresses in Pods will not be sync-ed to MailChimp, nor will changes to other fields once the email address has been changed.
